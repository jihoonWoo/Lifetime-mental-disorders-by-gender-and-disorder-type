#  Lifetime-mental-disorders-by-gender-and-disorder-type

This repository facilitates the process of generating insight from the Australia Mental health survey data. Specifically the software in this repository describes how we identified : “In 2007, 32% of females in Australians (16-85 years) reported experiencing anxiety at some point in their lifetime.”. 

The Australia Mental Health Survey data was collected from ABS-National-Survey-of-Mental-Health-and-Wellbeing (10.5281/zenodo.4939861)  Zenodo repository that contains information about Australians’ mental disorders, the associated disability, and the use of services. We created a Jupyter Notebook called “prepare_and_setup.ipynb” to read this data and extract insight by using Python code.
